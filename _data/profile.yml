    Hello, My name is Hyun-Young Moon, 4th year student at The Catholic University of Korea. 
  </p>
  <p>
      My research interests are in AI systems that understand the underlying meaning and contextual nuances 
    embedded in human language and content. In particular, I focus on integrating multimodal reasoning and 
    adaptive modeling to interpret intent, cultural codes, and implicit context beyond surface-level information.
