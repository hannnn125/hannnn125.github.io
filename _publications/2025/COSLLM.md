abstract: >-
  Construction standards across different countries provide technical guidelines to ensure the quality and safety of buildings and facilities, with periodic revisions to accommodate advances in construction technology. However, these standards often contain overlapping or conflicting content owing to their broad scope and interdependence, complicating the revision process and creating public inconvenience. Although current expert-driven manual approaches aim to mitigate these issues, they are time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. To address these challenges, we propose conflict and overlap classification in construction standards using a large language model (COSLLM), a framework that leverages a construction domain-adapted large language model for the semantic comparison of sentences in construction standards. COSLLM utilizes a two-step reasoning process that adaptively employs chain-of-thought reasoning for the in-depth analysis of sentences suspected of overlaps or conflicts, ensuring computational and temporal efficiency while maintaining high classification accuracy. The framework achieved an accuracy of 97.9% and a macro F1-score of 0.907 in classifying real-world sentence pairs derived from Korean construction standards as overlapping, conflicting, or neutral. Furthermore, we develop and deploy a real-time web-based system powered by COSLLM to facilitate the efficient establishment and revision of construction standards.
